# Overview

I wrote a memory card game in JavaScript, which is a web-based web application that provides an engaging and hopefully entertaining experience for users. By leveraging JavaScript, the program dynamically creates a deck of cards with distinct colors and numbers. The user interface enables players to flip pairs of cards, testing their memory and concentration to match identical pairs. The implementation involves event-driven programming, asynchronous functions, and efficient DOM manipulation, ensuring a responsive and enjoyable gaming experience. The objective is to find all matching pairs, and the game concludes with a congratulatory message when all pairs are successfully matched.

The primary purpose of creating this software was to showcase my JavaScript skills and understanding of DOM manipulation. I also wanted to improve and build upon my existing knowledge of JavaScript. I had limited experience with it, but had enough to 'get started', and so I chose this as my second module as it would allow me to learn whilst also giving me something I felt somewhat comfortable with.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Of course, I utilized Visual Studio Code for creating/runnning and debugging the code. To test and debug the application, I also relied on browser developer tools, especially the console for logging messages and debugging JavaScript code.

The core programming language used for this project was JavaScript. I used CSS and HTML to also create this program, as the JavaScript could not run/function without these. jQuery was employed as a library to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling, enhancing the efficiency of the code itself.

# Future Work

- Implementing a timer to add a time-based challenge to the game.
- Enhancing accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- Adding a scoring system to track and display the player's performance, with data that is backed up and can be viewed at any time (a leaderboard system).
- Improving the responsiveness of the game for various screen sizes and devices, and adjusting it so that the grid can be displayed in different ways.
- Exploring additional visual effects or animations to enhance the user experience. Things such as a flashing "Winner" on the screen, the cards actually flipping, etc. would enhance it significantly.
